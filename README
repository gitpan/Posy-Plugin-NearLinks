==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::NearLinks - Posy plugin to give links of articles in the
current category


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::NearLinks.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This provides a method which can be called from the "head" flavour template
(if one is using the TextTemplate plugin). This finds all the entries in the
current category, and their titles, and makes a list of links to them.

This depends on the Posy::Plugin::EntryTitles plugin to get the titles from
the entries. This depends on the Posy::Plugin::LinkList plugin to make the
actual list of links.
